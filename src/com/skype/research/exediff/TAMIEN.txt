WHAT'S IT?

If you are here, you are either a random visitor or curious about
the O(N log N) differencing algorithm BakeBread uses to compare
code sections in the dump and on the host. This is a stub of a help
page for the com.skype.research.exediff.Main entry point, intended
to be a general purpose file comparator. Unfortunately, heuristics
suitable for limited areas of ARM EABI executable code have proven
to be less meaningful for general purpose file comparison. If you'd
like to improve their stability, odds are you'll end up with a fast
comparator of very large files of more or less expected formats. As
of now, this entry point is not recommended for ordinary use.
